The **Dota 2 Quiz** is an application that asks the user to answer multiple choice questions about the MOBA game *Dota 2*. This app uses hardcoded questions and answers and uses javascript to render the information.

When the app loads, the user is able to start the quiz. Depending on their answer, they will receive 2 different options.
* A correct answer will give the user a point and render a specific gif.
* An incorrect answer will give the user 0 ponts, render a specific gif and give the user the correct answer. 

At the end, the user will get their results back with their final score and a button will appear to try again.
